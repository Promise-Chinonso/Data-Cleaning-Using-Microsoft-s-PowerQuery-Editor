### Data Cleaning: Inspecting and Wrangling the FIFA 21 Data Using PowerQuery

#### Background 
I organized a #datacleaningchallenge in the data-tech space alongside a fellow Data enthusiast in a bid to create an enabling environment to allow beginners, intermediates, and pro data analysts to flex their data cleaning skills. As the co-organizer, I was not left out as I also joined as a participant to transform the dataset provided for the challenge using Microsoft’s PowerQuery editor.

As you might already know, data cleaning and transformation is one of the core stages every data must go through before analysis. It ensures that the insights generated are accurate and not influenced by any inconsistencies, errors or dirtiness tied to the data.

### Specific objectives of the data cleaning process
• Ensure that all the columns have the correct data type
• Numerical columns should be in a format suitable for further calculations and analysis


Meeting these two objectives requires that a good number of factors be checkmated, some of which are; the presence of null entries, empty rows, special characters, irregularities, inconsistent naming conventions etc. 

#### About the data
The dataset used for this challenge is the FIFA 21 data. It was sourced from Kaggle. The dataset was obtained in its raw state after web scrapping from sofifa.com. It contains the details of football players alongside their performance, updated up till 2021. It is worth noting that there are 18979 rows and 77 columns present in the FIFA 21 data. 

#### Data Discovery and Cleaning
The dataset was imported into the Powerquery editor, and loaded for transformation.

The dataset from my observation had numerous issues that i fixed during the cleaning process. Follow me as I walk you through the process of transforming this data from its messy state to a clean state making it ready for analysis.
